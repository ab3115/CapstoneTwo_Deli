-An interesting peice of my code that I liked, although not the biggest feature, is the way my toppings are presented to the user as a list which reduces with each topping selected. I really liked the way this function appeared, however I also like it because it made me realize how else I could have deisgned the program, as I could have made ingredients as a static method so every sandwich could have the same preset ingredient set which, which could be very beneficial if an inventory system were to be implemented later on.
